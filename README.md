  ## Installation
  To install necessary dependencies, run the following command:

  ` npm i `

  ## Usage
  Update your .env file with your mysql password. Make sure that your mysql server is running and that you've dropped/created a database using the source schema.sql command. Once your db is set up you'll want to use npm run seed to add seeds to the db. Then you'll use npm run start to get the server up and running.
